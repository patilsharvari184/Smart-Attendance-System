# Face Recognition-Based Attendance System

## 📖 Overview
This project implements a **Face Recognition-Based Attendance System** using Python and OpenCV. It is designed to automate the process of attendance tracking in classrooms, offices, or any other organization by recognizing faces and marking attendance accurately.

## ✨ Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition using OpenCV.
- Stores attendance data in a structured format (e.g., CSV or database).
- Supports adding new users with facial data.
- User-friendly interface for managing attendance records.
- Scalable for larger datasets of faces.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
- **Database**: SQLite (or specify if you use any other database)
- **Other Tools**: Tkinter (if a GUI is included)
